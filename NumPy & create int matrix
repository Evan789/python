import numpy as np

# Using the Built-in functions you learned about on the
# previous page, create a 4 x 4 ndarray that only
# contains consecutive even numbers from 2 to 32 (inclusive)

X = np.linspace(2,32,16, dtype = int).reshape(4,4)
print(X)

output:
[[ 2  4  6  8]
 [10 12 14 16]
 [18 20 22 24]
 [26 28 30 32]]
